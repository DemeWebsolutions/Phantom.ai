Below is a clear, authoritative clarification of both instructions, written so there is no ambiguity about scope, replacement, or intent. This is phrased to be Copilot-safe and implementation-ready.

Reengineered Review Page — Required Contents
(Full Replacement of Current Content)
The existing Review page content must be entirely removed and replaced with the structure and elements below.

	2	Output Preview Window
	◦	Primary read-only text/code display
	◦	Syntax-highlighted where applicable
	◦	No inline editing permitted
	◦	Scrollable, fixed-height container
	3	Compliance & Validation Indicators
	◦	Flags for:
	▪	Formatting validity
	▪	Standard compliance
	▪	Security scan status (pass / warn / fail)
	◦	Indicator-only (no configuration controls)
	4	Review Actions (Mandatory)
	◦	Buttons:
	▪	Approve

	▪	Send Back for Revision
	◦	Actions update system state only (no regeneration here)
	5	Audit Metadata (Read-Only)
	◦	Reviewer (user or system)
	◦	Review time
	◦	Decision outcome
	◦	Logged automatically (no manual input)
Explicit Exclusions
The Review page must not contain:
	•	Prompt editing
	•	File uploads
	•	AI generation controls
	•	Settings or configuration toggles

Reengineered Files Page — Required Contents
(Full Replacement of Current Content)
The existing Files page content must be entirely removed and replaced with the structure and elements below.
Purpose
The Files page is the authoritative file and asset management surface for Phantom.ai, covering project context, AI artifacts, and uploaded resources.
Required Sections
	1	File Navigation Panel
	◦	Hierarchical list of:
	▪	Project files
	▪	Uploaded context files
	▪	Generated artifacts
	◦	Folder expand/collapse
	◦	No drag-and-drop required (optional later)
	2	File Preview Window
	◦	Read-only preview area
	◦	Supports:
	▪	Code (PHP, JS, CSS, JSON)
	▪	Text (MD, TXT)
	▪	Images (SVG, PNG, JPG)
	◦	Scrollable with fixed dimensions
	3	File Metadata Panel
	◦	File name
	◦	File type
	◦	Source (User Upload / AI Generated / System)
	◦	Last modified timestamp
	4	File Actions
	◦	View
	◦	Download
	◦	Mark as Context (for AI use)
	◦	Remove (if permitted)
	5	Artifact Classification
	◦	Labels indicating:
	▪	Review output
	▪	Copilot output
	▪	System-generated artifact
	◦	Read-only classification
Explicit Exclusions
The Files page must not contain:
	•	AI prompt inputs
	•	AI response generation
	•	Review approval actions
	•	System or security settings

Replacement Rule (Non-Negotiable)
	•	All existing content on both pages must be removed.
	•	No legacy UI elements may remain.
	•	These pages are single-purpose and must not overlap responsibilities with:
	◦	Workspace
	◦	Copilot / Cursor
	◦	System / Settings

Intent Summary
	•	Review Page = decision & validation
	•	Files Page = storage & inspection
This separation is mandatory for:
	•	Audit clarity
	•	Learning loop accuracy
	•	Copilot escalation correctness
	•	Long-term maintainability
These instructions are now fully clarified and ready for implementation.
